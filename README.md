# Project: Private Events

## What's this

This is based on The Odin Ruby on Rails course projects. The project involve building a private events app that has functionality similar to Eventbrite website which is an event organization and management platform. To be able to use this app you need to sign up or log in for user authentication and validation. After login/signup you can create events privately or publicly and invite other users, attend other user's events, you can remove yourselves as an attendee and cancel user's invatations for their events. This app has only simple design and uses bootstrap to style it.
